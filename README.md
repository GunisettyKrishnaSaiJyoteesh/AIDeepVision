# 🧠 AI-DeepVision: Crowd Monitoring System
### 👨‍🏫 Mentor: G.K.S Jyoteesh

---

## 🎯 Objective
The goal of this project is to build an **AI-powered real-time crowd monitoring system** capable of estimating **crowd density** and **detecting overcrowded zones** using surveillance video feeds.

Each student will individually develop, train, and deploy a deep learning model (CSRNet or MCNN) that can:
- Estimate the number of people in a video frame.
- Visualize crowd density through heatmaps.
- Trigger alerts when overcrowding occurs.

This project aims to enhance **public safety**, **crowd management**, and **smart city surveillance** through deep learning.

## 🧩 Project Tasks
1. Dataset preprocessing (ShanghaiTech Crowd Counting Dataset)
2. Model implementation (CSRNet / MCNN using PyTorch)
3. Model training and validation
4. Real-time video integration (OpenCV)
5. Dashboard development (Flask or Streamlit)
6. Alert system implementation (SMTP or Twilio)
7. Documentation and submission
